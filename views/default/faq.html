            This system of wallet helps you to recieve your deliveries from the online buying stores without worring about being present when the delivery boy arrives, because you have selected the cash on delivery option. You can put some cash in the wallet by making payment to the security personnel. (dont worry this is quite safe.) Now as the delivery comes, the security personnel checks your wallet. If the required cash is present in the wallet then he can make the payment and recieve your  order and updates your cash from the wallet.
